## Building and running

This project depends on Hugo (and, optionally, Go).  Installation instructions for both tools can be found here:

* [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/macos/)
* [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Once you've installed Hugo, you can build this blog with `hugo server` and navigate to the output URL to view content.  Follow the instructions in the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/) for more information on how to work with Hugo.
